## GET - :9001/
Sends a message, "Hola Mundo"

## POST - :9001/messages
Creates a payload with two parameters, destination and body. 
It has to follow some rules:
*These parameters must be present
*Their values must be strings 
*Destination has to be an email
*Their lengths have to be shorter than 100 

To avoid theses mistskaes I created if clauses such as:
*If destination or body misspelled or forgotten then a 400 status and a 'Missing key' message is sent
*If destination or body's values are missing then a 400 status and a 'Missing value' message is sent
*If destination or body's values aren't strings then a 400 status and a 'Values must be strings' message is sent
*If destination is not an email then a 400 status and a 'Destination needs to ba an email' message is sent00).json("Missing value")
*If destination or body's length is larger or equal to 100 then a 400 status and a 'Message is too long' message is sent

If none of these things go wrong, then the payload is created.
If nothing goes wrong then a 200 status and a 'Message created' message is sent
If something goes wrong then a 400 status and a 'Error while creating the message' message is sent

Three functions are used in this route:
1) This function is called sendMessage and it receives two parameters, destination and body. There's an established timeout of 3seconds to limit the amout of time the function can dwell in the request. Its goal is to make the request to axios
If the timeout is not exceeded, then the function enter into the then, a 200 status and a 'Message created' message is sent, and a message is created
If the timeout is exceeded, then a 400 status and a 'Error while creating the message' message is sent and a message is created
2) This function is called create and it three receives parameters, destination, body and status. Its goal is to create new messages
If this function is invoked while in the then, then a message is created with a 'OK - 200' status. If the message is created correctly, then it decreases the credit amount by 1
If this function in invoked in the catch and the error response is undefined, then a message is created with a 'TIMEOUT - 400' status. Else, the message's status is 'ERROR - 500'.


## GET - :9001/messages
This route finds all messages and it uses a function called find
If everything goes right then a 200 status and all the created messages are sent. 
If something goes wrong then a 500 status and an error message is sent.

## DELETE - :9001/messages
This route deletes all messages and it uses a function called delete
If everything goes right then a 200 status and a 'Messages deleted' message. 
If something goes wrong then a 500 status and an error message is sent.

## POST - :9001/credit
This route establishes or recharges credit, using one function called establish for the fisrt and recharge for the latter.
The recharge function accepts one parameter, amount. And it's added to the existing amount. There's a lock/unlock event while recharging.

If everything goes right then a 200 status and a 'Credits deleted' message. 
If something goes wrong then a 500 status and an error message is sent.

##QUESTIONS

What happens if the message request gives an error?
 - The message is created but the call never reaches the axios. If it were to fail, then the best thing would be to set a timeout, once it's exceeded then I would break the connection and retry to make the call again until the call is made. Or maybe it would be better to implement a system of piles where all the requests are lined up as they were made, and as they are being answered, to take those requests out of the line and if there are unanswered then to request them again.

Are the errors in the sending of a message and in the query of the registry equally important?
 - I think both errors are equally important as they interrupt the call's flow, however it depends on the application. It could be fixed with the proper use of then and catch, with the correct use of status codes and a message explaining why it failed (it's important to send different messages so not to confuse others).
